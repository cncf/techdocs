## Review

When creating a localization PR, request a review from the localization
reviewers. Refer to the [Projects](#projects) table for reviewers in each
repository. It is recommended to obtain approval from at least two localization
reviewers.

After obtaining approval from the localization reviewers, request the
maintainers of each repository to merge the PR.
