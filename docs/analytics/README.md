# Analytics

## Google Analytics

- [CNCF sandbox][] projects currently onboarding, should open a [Service Desk][]
  ticket to either:
  - Request a transfer of their existing GA properties to the **CNCF Projects**
    Google Analytics account. The first step is to make projects@cncf.io and
    Administrator of their existing GA account.
  - Request the creation of a new analytics property.
- For instructions on how to setup [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)][ga4] for your
  [Docsy][]-based website, see [Adding Analytics][].

> **Archived instructions**: for details on how to migrate from Universal
> Analytics to GA4, see
> [Migrating Universal to Google Analytics 4](ua-to-ga4.md).
