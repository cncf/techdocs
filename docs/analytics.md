# Analytics

This page describes how to setup or upgrade Google Analytics (GA) for your CNCF
project's website.

> **Deprecation notice**: Google's [Universal Analytics will be going away][ua]
> in 2023.

When adding analytics to a new CNCF project website, use [Google Analytics
4][ga4] (GA4).

## Adding Google Analytics

For instructions on how to setup [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)][ga4] for your
[Docsy][]-based website, see [Adding Analytics][].

## Migrating to Google Analytics 4

There are many ways to upgrade your project to [GA4][]. We describe one such
process below. Adapt it to your needs. Useful resources to consider include:

- **Developer resources** for [migrating to Google Analytics 4][ga4-dev],
  especially relevant is the following page:
  - [Add Google Analytics 4 to an existing Universal Analytics
    implementation][ga4+ua-dev]
- **Help center** resource: [Migrate from Universal Analytics to Google
  Analytics 4][migration-help]

### Phase 1 - create and activate a GA4 site tag

1.  Create an issue over the project's website with the title "Setup Google
    Analytics 4" and link to [Issue #108][]. For example, see the [etcd.io issue
    #595][].

2.  Create a GA4 site tag and [connect][] it to the existing UA id.

    From your project's UA console:

    - Select **Admin** (bottom of left-nav)
    - Select **Property Settings**
    - Change the property name (which usually matches the project name), by
      adding the following suffix: `- UA`
    - Go back to the **Admin** level settings
    - Select **GA4 Setup Assistant**
    - Select **I want to create a new Google Analytics 4 property > Get
      started**
    - Select **Go to your GA4 property**
    - Select **Admin** > **Data stream**
    - Select the (only) data stream
    - ðŸ“‹ Copy the **MEASUREMENT ID**, we'll need it later, and past it into the
      appropriate row of the [status table][]

3.  Configure your new GA4 tag:

    - If your site is using `gtag.js`, then you have nothing more to do. Proceed
      to the next step.
    - If your site is using `analytics.js`, then consider upgrading to `gtag.js`
      or at least adding a `gtag.js` configuration for the new GA4 site tag
      (while keeping the current `analytics.js` configuration). Once this is
      done, proceed to the next step.

4.  Ensure that the new GA4 site tag is receiving data.

    From GA4 console home, you should see **active users** in realtime --
    roughly the same number and distribution of active users reported by the UA
    console.

### Phase 2 - configure the GA4 ID as the main GA ID

- Ensure that the website supports the GA configuration of more than one id. If
  it doesn't, consider using a project-specific layout like the following:
  [opentelemetry.io/layouts/partials/google-analytics.html] (which was setup via
  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/pull/1544)
- Set the GA4 ID as the main GA ID

### Phase 3 - switch to native Docsy or Hugo support for GA

Eventually migrate to using the Docsy or Hugo support for GA IDs (@chalin plans
to upstream changes in 22Q3).
