# Lunr
[Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser. Lunr enables you to provide a great search experience without needing external, server-side, search services.

- Completely free and open source
- Full power for customization

# When Is It Best To Use One Over Another?
If you are looking to create a search capability for your open source project without having to depend on a 3rd party service, then you should consider using [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/). You can take a look at [this custom implementation](https://github.com/vitessio/website/pull/1119) or [Hugo/Docsy implementation](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/pull/403) to see the different ways we used Lunr to implement search.  

If you are looking to create a search engine that not only focuses on the contents of one website (site search), but on a particular topic from multiple sites, then you should consider the [Programmable Search Engine (Google search)](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview).
