# TechDoc Analysis Templates

This section contains templates for analyzing a CNCF project's documentation.

Use the templates in this directory to perform a documentation analysis for
CNCF. These materials provide:

- A relatively objective set of criteria (a "rubric") for evaluating existing
  documentation and website content, infrastructure, and support.
- An attempt to make the documentation analysis appropriate to the current (or
  proposed) maturity level for the overall project.
- Emphasis on effective documentation that serves all users associated with the
  project.

For guidance in completing a documentation analysis, see
[Analysis how-to](../howto.md) and [criteria](../criteria.md) pages.
