# Introduction

This document provides actionable suggestions for improving the _PROJECT_
technical documentation.

For an analysis and general discussion of recommendations on _PROJECT_ technical
documentation, see [_PROJECT_-analysis.md][].

## Recommendations, requirements, and best practices

This analysis measures documentation against CNCF project maturity standards and
suggests possible improvements. In most cases there is more than one way to do
things. Few recommendations here are meant to be prescriptive. Rather,
recommendations are based on documentation best practices as understood by the
reviewers. The recommended implementations represent the reviewers' experience
with how to apply those best practices. In other words, borrowing terminology
from the lexicon of [RFCs][rfc-keywords], the changes described here should be
understood as "recommended" or "should" at the strongest, and "optional" or
"may" in many cases. Any "must" or "required" actions are clearly denoted as
such, and pertain to legal requirements such as copyright and licensing issues.

The top-level documentation recommendations for this project are:

<!-- Provide a summary or outline of the recommendations. Depending on the analysis findings, recommended actions might be organized into two or three high-level items that contain multiple actions, or might just be a list of independent changes. For examples, see a completed implementation plan such as 0008-Backstage or 0010-etcd. -->
