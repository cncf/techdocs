# TechDoc Analysis Templates

This directory contains templates for analyzing a CNCF project's documentation.

## Contents

Use the templates in this directory to perform a documentation analysis for
CNCF. These materials provide:

- A relatively objective set of criteria (a "rubric") for evaluating existing
  documentation and website content, infrastructure, and support.
- An attempt to make the documentation analysis appropriate to the current (or
  proposed) maturity level for the overall project.
- Emphasis on effective documentation that serves all users associated with the
  project.

Resources for completing a documentation analysis, including a [how-to][] guide
and analysis [criteria][], are in the `docs` directory.

[how-to]: ../howto.md
[criteria]: ../criteria.md
