# CNCF TechDocs

This repository holds resources provided by the CNCF Technical Documentation team. The repo contains the following directories:

- `analysis` contains instructions, templates, and criteria for requesting and performing an analysis of an OSS project's website and technical documentation. Completed analyses are stored here as well.
- `resources` contains information that OSS teams can use to set up a documentation project as suggested by the Tech Docs team.

## The Technical Documentation Assistance Program

The CNCF Tech Doc team has created a program to assist CNCF-affiliated projects in creating effective documentation. [`TechDoc-Assistance-Program.md`](./TechDoc%20Assistance%20Program%20Outline.md) contains an outline of this program. 

Project maintainers are asked to understand that:
- Project documentation resources are *always* underestimated.
- Documentation is as much a real part of a project as code. 
- Effective documentation requires a real commitment of resources. 
- The TechDoc Assistance Program exists to help maintainers allocate these resources effectively, but cannot write documentation for you or 'fix' documentation problems. 

We're passionate about good documentation and we want to help your project succeed. Please work with us by taking this part of your project seriously.
