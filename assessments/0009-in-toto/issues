# Documentation Issues 

*DRAFT PROPOSAL for actionable issues* 

These issues identify and classify tasks that contributors can undertake to establish a set of organized and navigable documents on the in-toto public website.

- [ ] Umbrella issue for in-toto doc work
   - [ ] Create a Documentation home page on web site, linked prominently from About menu with map to existing doc
      - [ ] Create an index or map to existing docs as a temporary guide, preparatory to moving that information into RTD and integrating it into a doc architecture.
   - [ ] Create a Getting Started page on web site from README content for the main repo (https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto.README.md)
      - [ ] Link to new Getting Started page as first menu item in Get started menu (currently 1st item is link to demo)
   - [ ] Develop doc organization TOC based on user roles
- [ ] Factor out parts of Specification into separate named documents on website.   
   - [ ] Create a TOC for existing Specification
   - [ ] Expose parts of spec as separate documents
     - [ ] System Overview 
     - [ ] Glossary (convert to alphabetized table)
     - [ ] Workflow/Personas (clearly identify user types and point to relevant doc sections)
- [ ] Create layered overviews 
(compare content to https://in-toto.io/in-toto/README and current website About - create 3 or 4 versions of increasing depth to address to specific audiences) 
   - [ ] Create a high-level technical overview on the project home page suitable for *evaluators* (see User Roles). 
   - [ ] Create a mid-level technical overview for Getting Started suitable for *new project owners*
   - [ ] Create an in-depth technical overview suitable for *contributors* and *experienced project owners*.
