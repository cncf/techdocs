# README

These documents are intended to recommend a direction for the ongoing development of technical documentation for the in-toto open source software (OSS) project. This effort is funded by the CNCF Foundation as part of its overall effort to incubate, grow, and graduate open source cloud native software projects. According to CNCF best practices guidelines, effective documentation is a prerequisite for program graduation.

The [CNCF-techdocs](https://github.com/cncf/CNCF-techdocs/tree/main) group is developing a process aimed at assisting cloud-native open-source projects with their documentation efforts. The process has three steps:
1. Analysis

   A professional technical writer surveys the current project documentation and website, and analyzes it with respect to CNCF criteria for completeness, discoverability, and usability. 
   
2. Recommendations

   The analyst makes general recommendations for organizing, extending, and improving documentation to meet CNCF standards appropriate to the project's maturity status.
   
3. Doc Plan

   The analyst outlines a program of key improvements intended to provide the largest return on investment. 
This is an actionable plan for doc improvement, with specific implementation recommendations suitable to the open-source development environment.
