# README

These documents are intended to recommend a direction for the ongoing development of technical documentation for the in-toto open source software (OSS) project. This effort is funded by the CNCF Foundation as part of its overall effort to incubate, grow, and graduate open source cloud native software projects. According to CNCF best practices guidelines, effective documentation is a prerequisite for program graduation.

The [CNCF-techdocs](https://github.com/cncf/CNCF-techdocs/tree/main) group is developing a process aimed at assisting projects with their documentation efforts.  The process has three steps:
1. Analysis
2. Recommendations
3. Doc Plan

The results of the process are presented in these files. 
- [Survey of existing documentation](../survey-of-existing-documentation) (as of Sept 2023)
- [Analysis](../in-toto-analysis.md)
- [Recommendations and implementation](../in-toto-implementation.md)

The survey and analysis are working documents used to produce the recommendations. Project participants who are interested in the reasoning behind the recommendations can refer to them. 

## Analysis 

A professional technical writer surveys the current project documentation and website, and analyzes it with respect to CNCF criteria for completeness, discoverability, and usability. For this project, documentation surveyed was undertaken in September 2023.

## Recommendations 

The analyst makes general recommendations for organizing, extending, and improving documentation to meet CNCF standards appropriate to the project's maturity status. 

## Doc Plan

The analyst outlines a program of key improvements intended to provide the largest return on investment. 
This is an actionable plan for doc improvement, with specific implementation recommendations suitable to the open-source development environment.
