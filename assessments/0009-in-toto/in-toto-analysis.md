# Introduction
This document analyzes the effectiveness  and completeness of the in-toto open source software (OSS) project's documentation and website. It is funded by the CNCF Foundation as part of its overall effort to incubate, grow, and graduate open source cloud native software projects.
According to CNCF best practices guidelines, effective documentation is a prerequisite for program graduation. The documentation analysis is the first step of a CNCF process aimed at assisting projects with their documentation efforts.
## Purpose
This document was written to analyze the current state of in-toto documentation. It aims to provide project leaders with an informed understanding of their project documentation and to outline an actionable plan for improvement. This document:

- Analyzes the existing documentation with respect to CNCF criteria for completeness, discoverability, and usability.
- Recommends a program of key improvements with the largest return on investment
- Provides guidance to implementing the recommended improvements

## Scope of analysis
The documentation discussed here includes the contents of the website at https://in-toto.io and https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/, the in-toto Specification, and the documentation for contributors and users in the various GitHub repositories at https://github.com/in-toto. See [Survey of existing documentation](#survey-of-existing-documentation) below.

### How this document is organized

The document has two parts, [Analysis and recommendations](./assessments#analysis-and-recommendations-1)
 and [Implementation](./assessments#implementation).

### Analysis and recommendations

Recommendations are based on an analysis of the existing documentation. The analysis is divided into three sections that represent three major areas of concern:

- User documentation: concerns documentation for users of the in-toto framework; aimed at people who intend to implement or integrate the framework locally, and people who intend to use the local implementation.

- Contributor documentation: concerns documentation for new and existing contributors to the project.

- Website: concerns the mechanics of publishing the documentation; includes branding, website structure, and maintainability.

Each section begins with a summary of current status based on a rubric with appropriate criteria for the section, then proceeds to:

- Comments: observations about the existing documentation, with a focus on how it does or does not help in-toto users achieve their goals.

- Recommendations: suggested changes that would improve the effectiveness of the documentation.
