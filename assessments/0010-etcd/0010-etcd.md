# etcd CNCF tech docs analysis

Prepared by: Dave Welsch ([@dwelsch-esi][dwelsch-esi])<br>
Date: <draft-date>

## Introduction

This document assesses the quality and completeness of the [etcd][etcd-io] project's documentation and website. 

This document:

- Measures existing documentation quality against the CNCF’s standards
- Provides examples of great documentation as a reference
- Recommends a program of key improvements with the largest return on investment
- Provides guidance to making the recommended improvements actionable TBD


## How this document works

The assessment is divided into three sections:

- **Project documentation:** for end users of the project, aimed at people who intend to use it
- **Contributor documentation:** for new and existing contributors to the project
- **Website:** for branding, website structure, and maintainability

Each section begins with a rating based on a rubric with appropriate [criteria](criteria.md) for the section. The rubric uses the following scale:

| Rating | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Is not present |
| 2 | Needs improvement to meet project maturity standards |
| 3 | Meets project maturity standards |
| 4 | Meets or exceeds project maturity standards |
| 5 | Consistently exceeds project maturity standards |

The assessment also includes a summary of recommendations at the end.

## Project documentation

etcd is a **graduated** project of CNCF. This means that the project should have [*very high*](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs/blob/main/assessments/criteria.md) standards for documentation.

| Criterion                  |  Rating (1-5)  |
| ---                        |    ---   |
| Information architecture   |     2 - needs improvement    |
| New user content           |     3 - meets standards    |
| Content maintainability    |     3 - meets standards     |
| Content creation processes |     2 - needs improvement     |
| Inclusive language         |      2 - needs improvement    |


### Comments

The following sections contain brief assessments of each element of the Project Documentation rubric.

#### Information architecture

There is **high-level conceptual** and design content, but it is hidden in a section called *Learning* 2/3 of the way down the TOC. 

The section called *Learning*, right before *Developer guide* 2/3 down the ToC, is a catch-all for a lot of different types of information:

- An architectural overview (actually a fairly detailed explanation of how etcd's client and resiliency architectures work).
- Adoption decision information, in *etcd versus other key-value stores*. 
- Also a glossary.

There is a single paragraph on the [website][etcd-io] landing page with a "Learn more" link that goes to the current documetation table of contents.

As far as I can tell, the documentation is **feature complete**. It lacks an adequate introduction and overview.

There are **instructions** for features. These instructions include:

- A Quickstart guide
- Installation instructions
- Tutorials
- Instructions on how to tune the server cluster
- Using the CLI

... and other tasks and procedures.

There might be **undocumented tasks** associated with key features; a more thorough analysis of key use cases is required to make that determination.

The **"happy path"** is not a simple procedure, but I believe that there is sufficient documentation of the most common use cases (configure and run HA server cluster; set and get key-value pairs via an API from an application) to argue that it is documented.

Task and tutorial content is **clearly named according to user goals**. 

**Escalation paths** are clearly described in [Reporting bugs](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/reporting_bugs/) and [Triage](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/triage/).

The product provides a [**reference for the API**](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api/). The documentation also references many language-specific libraries used to integrate with etcd.

Documentation content is **up to date and is versioned**. The current documentation set is for the stable 3.5 release of etcd. The site also contains a draft version of documentation for the 3.6 release labeled "v3.6-DRAFT".

Examples:

* https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/


#### New user content

There are **install** and **quick start** entries in the ToC. 

The **installation** page gives step-by-step instructions for installing binaries, from source, and using a package manager. Installation as part of a Kubernetes installation is also described on the page, but there is a placeholder under the heading "Installation as part of Kubernetes installation".

There is an example **installation** on the [etcd Play](http://play.etcd.io/install) server.

Package manager installation is documented (but not recommended) for Linux and MacOS. **Other OSes** are alluded to but not documented. Supported platforms are documented in the [Operations guide](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/supported-platform/).

The *Quickstart* section lists suggested next steps in a *What's next?* heading. However, there is no such section on the *Installation* page, and in neither location is a clear **workflow path** delineated.

There is no **new user signpost** in the documentation. The closest equivalent is the *Quickstart* section, which has a rudimentary "What's next?" section as previously described.

The examples in the installation, configuration, and other documentation provide ample code to **copy-paste**.

Examples:

* https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/
* https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/


#### Content maintainability & site mechanics

Documentation is fully **searchable**. Searches are limited to the stable software version.

The website content folder contains a **language-specific directory** in its hierarchy, implying a mechanism for doing **internationalization** if necessary. There do not appear to be plans to translate the documentation from English.

Documentation content is **versioned** with the software. Versions are maintained in separate **directories** in the website content repo. 

Examples:

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/

#### Content creation processes

There are instructions for contributing to documentation and for **releasing a new version** of the etcd **documentation** in the `README.md` file in the [website repo](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/blob/main/README.md). The instructions are out of date and seem to require intervention to fix a bad current-version redirect. 

It's not immediately clear **who is responsible** for approving documentation PRs.

The website has a [**list of maintainers and reviewers**](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/blob/main/MAINTAINERS).

Examples:

* https://github.com/nats-io/nats-site/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md (clearly documented maintainers)
* https://thanos.io/tip/contributing/how-to-contribute-to-docs.md/

#### Inclusive language

Language is mostly inclusive. For example, the neutral terms "Leader" and "Follower" are used to describe server failover roles.

However, there are isolated instances of somewhat **non-inclusive language**. For example:

- [installation check][install-check]: contains "sanity check", a term designated "Strongly Consider Replacing" by the [Inclusive Naming Initiative][inclusive-naming].
- There is some use of language like "easy", "simple", and "just [take an action]"; for example, "Creating a user is as easy as" in [Role-based access control](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/authentication/rbac/).

### Recommendations

Lose the animated GIFs of CLI interactions. Especially the multi-window ones. They illustrate nothing and make the reader seasick.



## Contributor documentation

etcd is a **graduated** project of CNCF. This means that the project should have [*very high*](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs/blob/main/assessments/criteria.md) standards for documentation.

| Criterion                                 | Rating (1-5)   |
| ---                                       | --- | 
| Communication methods documented          |     | 
| Beginner friendly issue backlog           |     |
| “New contributor” getting started content |     | 
| Project governance documentation          |     | 

Scale:
| Rating | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Is not present |
| 2 | Is incomplete |
| 3 | Is complete but misplaced, distributed, or obscured |
| 4 | Is complete and meets project maturity standards |
| 5 | Exceeds project maturity standards |

### Comments

Instructions for building the website state that the local build starts the server on `localhost:8888`. It's actually `localhost:1313` which then starts `8888` Not sure why this is necessary yet. TBD.

#### Communication methods documented

**Communication channels** include a Google Group and Twitter, and are documented on the [Community][etcd-community] page. 

There is a link to the **GitHub** repository in the website footer. There are links on the Community page to the [**GitHub** Discussions][etcd-git-discuss]  page and the [How to contribute][etcd-howtocontrib].

The Community page has a schedule, minutes, and recordings of the project's biweekly **meetings**.

There does not seem to be any period broadcast communication like a **mailing list**.

Examples:
https://kubernetes.io/community/

#### Beginner friendly issue backlog

There is a label (`area/documentation`) for **documentation issues**. There is a separate **good first issue** label. Issues are generally **well documented** by submitters and discussed in the Issues forum.

There are a number of **stale issues**. Here's a summary of the age of open issues for etcd at the time of this writing:

| Age | Count | Histogram |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| < 1 mo | 16 | *** |
| 1 mo - 2 mo | 9 | ** |
| 2 mo - 3 mo | 15 | *** |
| 3 mo - 6 mo | 35 | ******* |
| 6 mo - 12 mo | 40 | ******** |
| > 12 mo | 54 | *********** |

Examples:

* https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.io/issues (all of open tracing’s backlogs are well maintained!)


#### New contributor getting started content

There is a [**Community**][etcd-community] page on the etcd website. There is no dedicated **"first-contributor"** document, but there are multiple resources and pointers in the general contributor instructions. New users should have minimal difficulty **finding help** if they need it.

Examples:

* https://github.com/helm/community
* https://github.com/backstage/community


#### Project governance documentation

* Is project governance clearly documented?

Examples:

* https://github.com/kubernetes/steering

### Comments

#### Single-source requirement

* Source for the website should reside in a _single_ repository.
* Source for the website should be separate from the project source code.
* Ideally, all website files should be in the **website repo** itself. Alternatively, files should be brought into the website repo via [git submodules][].
* If a project chooses to keep source files in multiple repos, they need a clearly documented strategy for managing mirrored files and new contributions.

#### Minimal website requirements

Except for archived projects, requirements are cumulative through project maturity levels so, for example, incubating projects must satisfy the requirements for sandbox projects.

Listed and acknowledged below are the (cumulative) _minimal_ website requirements for projects based on their [maturity level][website-min-reqs]: sandbox, incubating, graduated and archived.

| Maturity | Requirement | Met? |
| ---      | ---         | --- |
| Sandbox  | Majority of [Website guidelines][website-guidelines] satisfied |  |
| Sandbox | [Docs assessment][assess-howto] [submitting a request][cncf-servicedesk] completed. |  |
| Sandbox | **Project documentation** exists – somewhere. It is acceptable at this maturity level to link out to documentation that hasn't yet been integrated into the website. (May still be in the project GitHub repo, for example.) |  |
| Incubating | All [Website guidelines][website-guidelines] satisfied |  |
| Incubating | Request docs (re-)assessment through CNCF [service desk][cncf-servicedesk] |  |
| Incubating | **Project doc**: stakeholders (roles) identified and doc needs documented |  |
| Incubating | **Project doc**: Hosted directly |  |
| Incubating | **Project doc**: Comprehensive, addressing most stakeholder needs |  |
| Graduated | [Docs assessment][assess-howto]: all assessment follow-through actions are complete |  |
| Graduated | **Project doc** fully addresses needs of key stakeholders |  |
| Archived | The website repo is in an [archived state][archiving-repo] | n/a |
| Archived | Archived status of the project is obvious to site visitors | n/a |
| Archived | Link to successor project website and/or migration documentation (if it exists) | n/a |

#### Usability, accessibility and devices

**Mobile:**
* Is the website usable from mobile?
* Are doc pages readable?
* Are all / most website features accessible from mobile -- such as the top-nav,
  site search and in-page table of contents?
* Might a [mobile-first] design make sense for your project?

**Accessibility:**
* Are color contrasts significant enough for color-impaired readers?
* Are most website features usable using a keyboard only?
* Does text-to-speech offer listeners a good experience?

Examples:

* https://helm.sh/

#### Branding and design

* Is there an easily recognizable brand for the project (logo + color scheme) clearly identifiable?
* Is the brand used across the website consistently?
* Is the website’s typography clean and well-suited for reading?

Examples:

* https://helm.sh/


#### Case studies/social proof

* Are there case studies available for the project and are they documented on the website?
* Are there user testimonials available?
* Is there an active project blog?
* Are there community talks for the project and are they present on the website?
* Is there a logo wall of users/participating organizations?

Examples:

* https://www.fluentd.org/testimonials (user testimonials)
* https://goharbor.io/ (logo wall)
* https://blog.rook.io/ (blog)


#### SEO, Analytics and site-local search

**Analytics:**
* Is analytics enabled for the production server?
* Is analytics disabled for all other deploys?
* If your project used Google Analytics, have you migrated to GA4?
* Can Page-not-found (404) reports easily be generated from you site analytics? Provide a sample of the site's current top-10 404s.

**Indexing and Search:**
* Is site indexing supported for the production server, while disabled for website previews and builds for non-default branches?
* Is local intra-site search available from the website?

* Are the current custodian(s) of the following accounts clearly documented: analytics, Google Search Console, site-search (such as Google CSE or Algolia)

#### Maintenance planning

* Is your website tooling well supported by the community (i.e., Hugo with the Docsy theme) or commonly used by CNCF projects (our recommended tech stack?)
* Are you actively cultivating website maintainers from within the community?
* Are site build times reasonable?
* Do site maintainers have adequate permissions?

Examples:

* http://kubernetes.io

#### Other

* Is your website accessible via HTTPS?
* Does HTTP access, if any, redirect to HTTPS?

### Recommendations

TBD
