# Assessment template 

## Introduction

Prepared by: `Name`
Date: `Date`

This is an assessment of your project documentation and website (if present), prepared for you and your project by the CNCF techdocs team.

This document aims to:

- Measure existing documentation quality against the CNCF’s standards
- Recommend specific and general improvements
- Provide examples of great documentation as reference 
Identify key areas which will net the largest improvement if addressed 

## How this document works

The assessment is divided into three sections: 

- **Project documentation:** for end users of the project; aimed at people who intend to use it
- **Contributor documentation:** for new and existing contributors to the project
- **Website:** branding, website structure, and maintainability

Within each section you receive a rating on different criteria. The full definition of each criteria is defined in [the criteria](criteria.md). We recommend reading each criterion’s definition.
