## Introduction

This document assesses the quality and completeness of a project's documentation and website (if present).

This document:

- Measures existing documentation quality against the CNCF’s standards
- Recommends specific and general improvements
- Provides examples of great documentation as reference
- Identifies key improvements with the largest return on investment


## How this document works

The assessment is divided into three sections:

- **Project documentation:** for end users of the project; aimed at people who intend to use it
- **Contributor documentation:** for new and existing contributors to the project
- **Website:** branding, website structure, and maintainability

Each section rates content based on different [criteria](criteria.md).
