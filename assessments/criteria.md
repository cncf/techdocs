# Assessment criteria and examples

## Project documentation

### Information architecture

The overall structure (pages/subpages/sections/subsections) of your project documentation. We evaluate on the following:

* Is there high level conceptual/“About” content?
Is the documentation feature complete? (i.e., each product feature is documented)
* Are there step-by-step instructions (tasks, tutorials) documented for features?
* Are there any key features which are documented but missing task documentation?
* Is the “happy path”/most common use case documented?
Does task and tutorial content demonstrate atomicity and isolation of concerns? (Are tasks clearly named according to user goals?)
* If the documentation does not suffice, is there a clear escalation path for users needing more help? (FAQ, Troubleshooting)
* If the product exposes an API, is there a complete reference?
* Is content up to date and accurate?

Examples:

* https://prometheus.io/docs/


### New user content

New users are the most avid users of documentation, and need content specifically for them. We evaluate on the following:

* Is “getting started” clearly labeled? (“Getting started”, “Installation”, “First steps”, etc.)
* Is installation documented step-by-step?
* If needed, are multiple OSes documented?
* Do users know where to go after reading the getting started guide?
* Is your new user content clearly signposted on your site’s homepage or at the top of your information architecture?
* Is there easily copy-pastable sample code or other example content?

Examples:

* https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/


### Content maintainability & site mechanics

As a project scales, concerns like localized (translated) content and versioning become large maintenance burdens, particularly if you don’t plan for them.

We evaluate on the following:

* Is your documentation searchable?
* Are you planning for localization/internationalization with regards to site directory structure? Is a localization framework present?
* Do you have a clearly documented method for versioning your content?


Examples:

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/

### Content creation processes

Documentation is only as useful as it is accurate and well-maintained, and requires the same kind of review and approval processes as code.

We evaluate on the following:

* Is there a clearly documented (ongoing) contribution process for documentation?
* Does your code release process account for documentation creation & updates?
* Who reviews and approves documentation pull requests?
* Does the website have a clear owner/maintainer?

Examples:

* https://github.com/nats-io/nats-site/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md (clearly documented maintainers)
* https://thanos.io/tip/contributing/how-to-contribute-to-docs.md/

### Inclusive language

Creating inclusive project communities is a key goal for all CNCF projects.

We evaluate on the following:

* Are there any customer-facing utilities, endpoints, class names, or feature names that use non-recommended words as documented by the [Inclusive Naming Initiative](https://inclusivenaming.org) website?
* Does the project use language like "simple", "easy", etc.?

## Contributor documentation

### Communication methods documented

One of the easiest ways to attract new contributors is making sure they know how to reach you.

We evaluate on the following:

* Is there a Slack/Discord/Discourse/etc. community and is it prominently linked from your website?
* Is there a direct link to your GitHub organization/repository?
* Are weekly/monthly project meetings documented? Is it clear how someone can join those meetings?
* Are mailing lists documented?

Examples:

* https://prometheus.io/community/

### Beginner friendly issue backlog

We evaluate on the following:

* Are docs issues well-triaged?
* Is there a clearly marked way for new contributors to make code or documentation contributions (i.e. a “good first issue” label)?
* Are issues well-documented (i.e., more than just a title)?
* Are issues maintained for staleness?

Examples:

* https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.io/issues (all of open tracing’s backlogs are well maintained!)

### New contributor getting started content

Open source is complex and projects have many processes to manage that. Are processes easy to understand and written down so that new contributors can jump in easily?

We evaluate on the following:

* Do you have a community repository or section on your website?
* Is there a document specifically for new contributors/your first contribution?
* Do new users know where to get help?

Examples:

* https://github.com/helm/community

### Project governance documentation

One of the CNCF’s core project values is open governance.

We evaluate on the following:

* Is project governance clearly documented?

Examples:

* Any graduated CNCF project

## Website

### Single-source requirement

Source files for _all website pages_ should reside in a _single_ repo.
Otherwise, having source files in two places will confuse contributors (who
won't know which file(s) to update) and you'll run the risk of losing updates
&mdash; [as has happened already][otel-changes-lost].

Ideally, all website files should be in the **website repo** itself.
Alternatively, files should be brought into the website repo via [git
submodules][].

If a project chooses to keep source files in multiple repos, they need a clearly
documented strategy for managing mirrored files and new contributions.

### Minimal website requirements

Listed here are the _minimal_ website requirements for projects based on their
[maturity level][]: sandbox, incubating, graduated and archived.

Except for archived projects, requirements are cumulative through project
maturity levels so, for example, incubating projects must satisfy the
requirements for sandbox projects.

- **Sandbox**
  - [Website guidelines][]: majority of the guidelines are satisfied
  - [Docs assessment][]: consider [submitting a request][service desk] for an
    assessment as early as possible to avoid documentation and website rework.
  - **Project documentation** may or may not be present -- it is acceptable at
    this maturity level to link out to documentation that hasn't yet been
    integrated into the website
  - _Example_: website with a single homepage, without any documentation or, as
    was mentioned above, linking out to an external (preexisting) source for
    docs
- **Incubating**
  - [Website guidelines][]: all guidelines are satisfied.
  - [Docs assessment][]: request an (re-)assessment through the CNCF [service
    desk][]
  - **Project documentation**:
    - Stakeholders / personas are identified and their core needs (in terms of
      docs) documented
    - Hosted directly on the website (also see [Single-source requirement])
    - Comprehensive, addressing most stakeholder needs
- **Graduated**
  - [Docs assessment][]: follow-through actions from any assessment are complete
  - **Project documentation** fully addresses the needs of key stakeholders
- **Archived**
  - The website repo is in an [archived state][]
  - The archived status of the project must be obvious to those visiting the
    website, such as through the use of a prominent banner.
  - If a successor project exists, link to it's website and/or migration
    documentation.

### Usability, accessibility and devices

Most CNCF websites are accessed from mobile and other non-desktop devices at
least 10-20% of the time. Planning for this early in your website's design will
be much less effort than retrofitting a desktop-first design.

* Is the website usable from mobile?
* Are doc pages readable?
* Are all / most website features accessible from mobile -- such as the top-nav,
  site search and in-page table of contents?
* Might a [mobile-first] design make sense for your project?

[mobile-first]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Responsive/Mobile_first

Plan for suitable [accessibility][] measures for your website. For example:

* Are color contrasts significant enough for color-impaired readers?
* Are most website features usable using a keyboard only?
* Does text-to-speech offer listeners a good experience?

It is up to each project to set their own guidelines.

### Branding

CNCF seeks to support enterprise-ready open source software. A key aspect of
this is branding and marketing.

We evaluate on the following:

* Is there an easily recognizable brand for the project (logo + color scheme)
  clearly identifiable?
* Is the brand used across the website consistently?
* Is the website’s typography clean and well-suited for reading?

Examples:

* https://helm.sh/

### Case studies/social proof

One of the best ways to advertise an open source project is to show other organizations using it.

We evaluate on the following:

* Are there case studies available for the project and are they documented on the website?
* Are there user testimonials available?
* Is there an active project blog?
* Are there community talks for the project and are they present on the website?
* Is there a logo wall of users/participating organizations?

Examples:

* https://www.fluentd.org/testimonials (user testimonials)
* https://goharbor.io/ (logo wall)
* https://blog.rook.io/ (blog)

### Maintenance planning

Website maintenance is an important part of project success, especially when project maintainers aren’t web developers.

We evaluate on the following:

* Is your website tooling well supported by the community (i.e., Hugo with the
  Docsy theme) or commonly used by CNCF projects (our recommended tech stack?)
* Are you actively cultivating website maintainers from within the community?
* Are site build times reasonable?
* Do site maintainers have adequate permissions?

Examples:

* http://kubernetes.io

### Other

* Is your website accessible via HTTPS?
* Does HTTP access, if any, redirect to HTTPS?
