# Backstage umbrella issue

## Overview 

This is a master list of issues recommended in the Backstage tech doc analysis and implementation plan. 

Where possible, issues are self-contained and require a defined level of effort. However, some issues require extended effort; for example, issues that require reorganizing all or most of the technical documentation. 

## Issues

### Rewrite technical overview

- [ ]

Rewrite a basic technical overview. Include: Purpose, features, and benefits of Backstage (without getting too sales-y); core features; basics of architecture including plugins. This is a conceptual document; omit how-to and reference information. Put at top of documentation and link from product landing page.

Audience: Evaluators and users who need to find their way around the product without modifying it.

Type: Conceptual

### Rewrite architectural overview

- [ ]

This is an in-depth overview of the Backstage product, probably in several web pages. Include a conceptual overview of the frontend, the backend, and plugin-based architecture. Briefly describe APIs (with links to API references, but no syntax reference here).

Audience: Integrators and contributors. Possibly admins and developers who need to configure plugins.

Type: Conceptual

### Rewrite standalone installation instructions

- [ ]

Rewrite the standalone installation. Make clear that this is a non-production install that a user might want to do for one of several reasons: demo, proof of concept, development environment, etc. Organize under *Getting Started* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Developer, Admin

Type: Task

### Write production installation instructions

- [ ]

Reorganize and rewrite the production-oriented installations, gathered here in Getting Started. Start with an introduction to help select an install configuration. Include a section for every install configuration: Kubernetes; Heroku; distributed plugins (as in "New Backend" in existing doc); any others. End with *Next Steps* section with links to configuration, setup, administration docs. Organize under *Getting Started* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Admin

Type: Task

### Write start and stop instructions for production Backstage server

- [ ]

Write step-by-step instructions to start, restart, check status, and stop a production Backstage server. Include a separate procedure for every install configuration (Kubernetes, standalone, etc.). Add procedures for any other server-related actions needed by the admin. Can also include sections on tuning server performance in each case. Organize under *Admin Guide* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Admin

Type: Task

### Write instructions for installing and configuring plugins

- [ ]

Write step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring a plugin. Include how to test the plugin if there's a generic way to do that. Organize under *Admin Guide* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Admin

Type: Task

### Write a guide to upgrading Backstage

- [ ]

Write a guide to upgrade or downgrade the version of Backstage. Include instructions on how to check and update dependencies. Organize under *Admin Guide* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Admin

Type: Task

### Write a database guide for Backstage

- [ ]

Write procedures for setting up and maintaining a database for Backstage. Include a separate procedure for every DBMS that can be used. Organize under *Admin Guide* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Admin

Type: Task

### Write a Getting Started guide for developers

- [ ]

Write a short guide for developers to get started with an existing production Backstage app (or a standalone server in a development environment). Include any tools that need to be installed and how to access the UI. Include a *Next Steps* section that points to the Developer User Guide. Organize under *Getting Started* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Developer

Type: Task

### Write a basic Developer Guide

- [ ]

Write a guide to managing a product in Backstage. Topics include adding, updating, and releasing a a product. This might need to be expanded based on type of product and for different code repo and CI/CD systems, but this should provide an entry point outlining tasks that are common to all products and environments, with links to more specific instructions. Organize under *Developer* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Developer

Type: Task

### Write a guide to the UI. 

- [ ]

Write a guide to using the UI to find and explore products. Currently there is no documentation to using the UI. A complete guide to the UI is probably unnecessary, but the tasks that represent the core value prop should be documented, including how to search for and examine products â€“ especially services and APIs meant to be usable by other developers. Organize under *Developer* in the doc TOC.

Audience: Developer

Type: Task

### Write an integrator guide

- [ ]

Write a guide to developing a basic plugin. Include step-by-step instructions to creating and deploying a bare-bones plugin. This should provide a jumping-off point to other integrator tasks of an increasingly advanced nature, such as proxies, security, and integrating with specific systems. Organize under *Integrator* or *Getting Started* (or both) in the doc TOC.

Audience: Integrator

Type: Task

### Reorganize TOC around user roles

- [ ]

Reorganize the documentation table of contents around user roles. A suggested high-level organization:
- Introduction and technical overview
- Getting started (subsections organized by user role)
- Administrator Guide
- Developer Guide
- Integrator Guide
- Reference

In practice, this will have to be done gradually as material is reorganized and rewritten within the documentation set. Much of this reorganization can be done in the form of new sections associated with other Backstage documentation issues. For example, the Getting Started TOC entry already exists; it can be reorganized as the Admin and Developer "getting started" sections are completed. Admin and Developer guides can be added with some rewritten task-based documentation. They can contain pointers to existing documentation pages until those pages are replaced or rewritten.

### Compile glossary

- [ ]

Compile a comprehensive Backstage glossary using definitions already found in the documentation plus new definitions. Many proposed entries were written while compiling the Backstage doc analysis.

Audience: All

Type: Reference

### Compile knowledge base

- [ ]

Replace the FAQ with an indexed knowledge base. The knowledge base is an encyclopedic collection of related background, conceptual, and reference information that doesn't fit elsewhere in the documentation.

Audience: All

Type: Conceptual

### Website: Create a logo wall

- [ ]

Create a logo wall containing a recognizable selection of organizations that use the product. Link each logo to the organization's website.

Audience: Evaluator

Type: Marketing

### Website: Write case studies

- [ ]

Write a representative selection of case studies. Link from the product main page. 

Audience: Evaluator

Type: Marketing, conceptual

### Website: Single-source repo

- [ ]

Move the Backstage documentation out of the Backstage repo and into its own repo within the Backstage project. Write explicit instructions for contributing to documentation and place them in the repo README.

In the meantime, put references to the documentation contributing and build instructions alongside the project code instructions in the contributor documentation in the Backstage repo.

### Website: Accessibility

- [ ]

Improve compliance by providing alternative text for images.
