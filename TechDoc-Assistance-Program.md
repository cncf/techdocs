# Technical Documentation Assistance Program

This document outlines the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Technical Documentation Assistance Program (the Program), a service offered by CNCF Tech Docs for evaluating and improving an OSS project's technical documentation. The process is designed to:

1. Provide a baseline analysis of the project's documentation quality measured against the project's [maturity level]. (Often, documentation help is requested when a project requests promotion to a new maturity level.)
1. Recommend changes that will reduce the gap between the documentation and the maturity of the overall project.
1. Expand on the recommended changes in an implementation plan.
1. Break down the implementation into a documentation project backlog comprising an Issues (in GitHub) list.
1. Support the project team's contributors in taking up and completing the issue backlog items.
1. Leave the project team with an improved understanding and skill base for improving and maintaining the project documentation.

This outline is a working document that presents current aspirations for the Program. It describes both existing elements of the Program and elements that are under discussion. All elements described are existing unless indicated by **TBD**.

## Phase 0: Training

Some level of familiarity with the technical documentation process is required to:

- Work effectively with technical writers
- Draft technical documentation (for non-writers)
- Improve the chances of a good outcome from the Tech Doc Assistance Program

For this reason, CNCF offers free training on documentation essentials for project contributors and maintainers. To get the most from the Technical Documentation Assistance Program, project contributors should do the training *before* engaging a documentation specialist to complete the documentation analysis.

The training program consists of the following online courses. Anyone can sign up for and complete the courses at their own pace.

## Phase 1: Documentation Analysis

A technical writer (on CNCF staff or on contract) analyzes the documentation. Based on the standards developed by the CNCF Tech Docs program, the writer:

1. Estimates the maturity level of the documentation compared to the current or desired maturity level of the software project, based on a number of criteria in three categories, using a rubric developed by CNCF. The categories are:
  1. Project documentation: The end-user documentation for the project's work product, typically (but not always) an application, API, protocol, or some other software product.
  1. Contributor documentation: Documentation about the project, aimed at project contributors and describing procedures, infrastructure, and customs for doing project work. This includes artifacts that define procedures and governance; recruit, orient, and train project contributors; and name responsible parties (project leaders, often generically called *maintainers*).
  1. Website: The technical infrastructure behind the documentation and the project's web presence, including website generation, versioning, SEO, analytics, and security.
1. Collaborates with project leadership to identify user roles and objectives for software users. If leadership
1. Proposes changes, if necessary, to the organization and content of the documentation to close gaps with the proposed maturity level.

## Phase 2: Issues

Once a high-level improvement plan has been written and approved, the tech writer:

1. Analyzes the proposed changes to create a roadmap to move the project toward the proposed level.
2. Creates issues for specific writing assignments and other tasks to improve the documentation. 

The issues are graded on two axes:

- Impact: How important the issue is to 1) improving the doc effectiveness and 2) moving the doc toward the desired maturity level.
- Effort: Amount of work the issue is estimated to require to complete. This includes primarily the work of writers and editors, but also SME discussion, review, and approval.

Of course, it's recommended that the project prioritize higher impact and lower effort issues first.

## Phase 3: Implementation

Community members work on the issues created in the previous phase. Ideally, tech writers are available to advise contributors and edit work, especially if the contributing community members are not trained technical writers.

## Phase 4: Impact Analysis

To gauge the effectiveness of the documentation effort, we recommend that the project track the documentation issues. Projects are encouraged to collect further metrics on documentation effectiveness. At a minimum though, tracking the issues should provide a guide to progress on leveling the documentation maturity to that of the project.
