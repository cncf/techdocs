# TechDoc Analysis Templates

This directory contains templates for analyzing a CNCF project's documentation. 

## Contents

Use the templates in this directory to perform a documentation analysis for CNCF. These materials provide:
- A relatively objective set of criteria (a "rubric") for evaluating existing documentation and website content, infrastructure, and support.
- An attempt to make the documentation analysis appropriate to the current (or proposed) maturity level for the overall project.
- Emphasis on effective documentation that serves all users associated with the project.

Resources for completing a documentation analysis, including a [how-to][] guide and analysis [criteria][], are in the `docs` directory.

[how-to]: ../docs/howto.md
[criteria]: ../docs/criteria.md
