# Netlify and domain setup 

## Netlify

If a project already has its own Netlify instance, ask them to add @celestehorgan and @caniszczyk as administrators. As a part of their project onboarding, any billing information should be taken care of. If it isn't, ask them to open a [CNCF Service Desk](https://github.com/cncf/servicedesk) ticket. 

If a project does not have a website, or is migrating from using GitHub pages to Netlify, create a new site for them under the CNCF Projects netlify instance. 

### Netlify maintainers

- Ensure that @celestehorgan and @caniszczyk are Owners if they are not already.
- Contact the project and ask for **at least two** maintainers for Netlify. You will need their GitHub usernames. Add them either as Collaborators to specific sites (if in the CNCF Projects Netlify team) or as Collaboators for the Netlify team. 

## Domains 

If a project has a pre-existing domain, this should be transferred to the CNCF during their onboarding process. 

If a project is new and does not have a domain name, they should open a [CNCF Service Desk](https://github.com/cncf/servicedesk) ticket to arrange for one. 

In most cases, we prefer to manage domains for project websites using Netlify DNS.

At the moment, @caniszczyk manages domain transfers.

### Netlify DNS domains

When using Netlify DNS, we delegate the domain from another provider to Netlify DNS. Read [Netlify DNS](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/) for more.

### Alias domains and projects with multiple domain names

Some projects have more than one domain name and want all of them to point to their website. In this case, read [Multiple Domains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/multiple-domains/) for more information, and ask them to open a [CNCF Service Desk](https://github.com/cncf/servicedesk) ticket.

### Domains that don't point to Netlify websites

Occasionally projects have domain names that don't point to websites. These are used for, among other things, email addresses. 

Issues related to these should be forwarded on to Linux Foundation IT staff.
