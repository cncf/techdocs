FAQ,,,,,,
FAQ,https://backstage.io/docs/FAQ,reference,all,any,KB,"This is a fairly robust FAQ. I usually recommend doing away with a FAQ on the grounds that it's a last resort for someone looking for information. Distribute its topics to where they belong in the documentation. Use a knowledge base (similar, but longer-format articles with conceptual information only) for miscellaneous, indexed, conceptual information."
Experimental Backend System,,,,,,
Introduction,https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/,concept,"contributor, admin",deployment,Contributor reference,"Information about a refactoring of existing functionality should be kept in the developer (contributor) discussion until it is deployed, at which point it should be documented in the release notes. Mentions of timing (""this component is in alpha""; ""currently this works like this""; ""we plan to ..."") should be avoided entirely in the product regular documentation. Version-specific information should be documented at the time of release in the release notes. If the change affects functionality, the new functionality should replace the old in the documentation set starting at the new version of the doc."
