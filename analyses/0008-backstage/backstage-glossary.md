## Catalog

An organization's portfolio of software products managed in Backstage.

## Cloud Native Computing

A set of technologies that "empower organizations to build and run scalable
applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid
clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and
declarative APIs exemplify this approach."
([CNCF Cloud Native Definition v1.0](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md)).

## Cloud Native Computing Foundation

A foundation dedicated to the promotion and advancement of
[Cloud Native Computing](#cloud-native-computing). The mission of the Cloud
Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is "to make cloud native computing
ubiquitous"
([CNCF Charter](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md)).

CNCF is part of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

## CNCF

organization. The only [user role](#user-role) with a pre-deployment
[use case](#use-case).

## Integrator

Someone who develops one or more plugins that enable Backstage to interoperate
with another software system. A [user role](#user-role).

## Kind

Classification of an [entity](#entity) in the Backstage Software Catalog, for
