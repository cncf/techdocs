# Implementation

## Organizational principles

Review the
[CNCF website design guidelines](../../docs/website-guidelines-checklist.md) for
project home page and architecture recommendations. Consult with CNCF TechDocs
or other technical documentation specialists to develop an appropriate
information architecture based on different user roles and their specific tasks
and information needs.

To efficiently transfer relevant information to the people who need it, organize
documentation with the product users' roles in mind. For example:

- End-users with specific roles should be clearly directed to instructional
  material for performing specific tasks.
- Administrators who are configuring the tool have a different set of tasks, and
  require different instructions and reference material.
- Spec implementors are another reader population who need information on how to
  provide reference doc for their implementations.
- Contributors should be pointed to the contribution and governance rules, and
  be able to find good first issues to get started on.

Similarly, the depth and detail of introductory conceptual material should be
clearly addressed to and tailored to:

- _Evaluators_ who are deciding whether to adopt the tools and methodology. This
  could be on the main website, with a marketing slant.
- _New users_ who will need to either integrate or configure the tools. This
  could be the intro that is on or linked prominently from the Doc Home Page.
- _Potential contributors_ who are planning to extend the tools or implement the
  specification. These readers require more depth of information about the
  architectural intentions and decision criteria, which would just be confusing
  and unnecessary to other reader populations.

See a more detailed analysis of reader roles and their documentation needs
below.

### User roles

To get the right information to the right reader, each page should be explicitly
addressed to a specific audience, and the organization and navigation for the
site should explicitly direct users of different types to relevant sections.

- The website (both the in-toto home page and the doc home page) should clearly
  identify and name the user roles, and what users in those roles need and can
  reasonably expect from in-toto documentation.
- The documentation should be organized into sections that are clearly aimed at
  users in specific roles with similar goals and information needs.
- If a page is useful for users with different roles, it should be linked from
  the section overviews for all relevant roles.

Users with the following roles are potential audiences for in-toto project
documentation.

| User Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Doc needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **End users** can be _Project owners_ and _Functionaries_.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | End users can be new or experienced. New users need a clear learning path and general examples. Experienced users need reference docs and use-case examples.                                                                                                                            |
| **Project owners** define the layout to be followed when, e.g., using the in-toto CLI tools. When doing so, they specify who is intended to sign for every piece of link metadata, any sub-layouts that may exist, and how to further verify accompanying metadata. | New users need an overview, demos, templates, and basic instructions. Experienced users need deeper architectural info, use cases, and examples.                                                                                                                                        |

## General doc plan

To begin achieving the goal of documentation that meets the needs of different
user populations and is discoverable by the intended readers, we recommend the
following general plan.

1. Initial tasks:

   a. Create a Documentation home page on the
   [project web site](https://in-toto.io), linked prominently from the About
   menu.

   b. Create a **Getting Started** page on the web site from the existing README
   content in the [main repo](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto).

   c. Link **Getting Started** as the first menu item in the **Get started**
   menu (currently the first item is a link to a demo).

   d. Expose parts of the product specification as separate named documents on
   the website, as:

   - [System Overview](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#2-system-overview)
     (compare content to <https://in-toto.io/in-toto> and current website
     About - create versions of increasing depth to address to specific
     audiences)
   - [Glossary](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#17-terminology)
     (convert to alphabetized table)
   - [Workflow/Personas](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#2-system-overview)
     (clearly identify user types and point to relevant doc sections)

2. Create a high-level technical overview on the project home page suitable for
   evaluators (see [User Roles](#user-roles)). This might be one of the existing
   overviews, or can be adapted from them.

3. Create an index or map to existing docs as a temporary guide, preparatory to
   moving that information into RTD and integrating it into a doc architecture.

4. Encourage documentation contributions:
   - Add Documentation as a contribution area, and clarify the process.
     Contributor docs should:
     - List reviewers/approvers for doc changes and additions.
     - Encourage the use of Documentation and Good First Issue tags for issues
       and PRs.
     - Make doc contributors responsible for updating doc roadmaps/ToCs, to
       reflect any changes they make to the doc structure (adding or moving
       documents).
   - Specify a documentation "champion" to review and approve doc PRs, decide
     doc issue priorities -- Justin Cappos?
   - Develop doc standards (style guide, page templates, locations)
   - Develop doc architecture
   - Develop and document a doc versioning/update process that includes updating
     the Doc home page as locations change and doc is added.

## Actionable items

1. Create **Doc home page**

   The landing page for the
   [read-the-docs site](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which
   currently lands on the auto-generated Python reference doc, could be expanded
   and repurposed as the new overall **Doc home page**.

   This is a necessary step in raising the maturity level of this project.
   Initially, the page should be a roadmap that describes and provides access
   to: - Specification - Basic demo - Python reference implementation along with
   its reference docs (which need to move into a sub-directory) - Overview of
   the git repo structure.

   1.1 Create a _top-level roadmap_ to
   [existing docs](survey-of-existing-doc.md) at the location decided on for the
   Doc home page.

   1.2 Move the Description and pointer to the Python Reference implementation
   to an **Implementations** section, and move the RTD reference docs for it
   into this section.

   1.3 Create a doc contributors policy requiring that the Doc home page be
   updated to reflect any changes to the doc locations and structure.

2. Expose new-user information

   2.1 Move the content of the
   [README for the main repo](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto) to a separate
   **"Getting Started" document**, with a prominent pointer on the in-toto home
   page, such as the top menu item in the "Get Started" menu. Replace the README
   with brief introductory notes that link to the documentation.

   2.2 As a stop-gap, add a top-level TOC for the existing Specification to show
   what is in it.

   2.3 Move important sections out of the spec into separate documents, and add
   them to the Doc home-page TOC.

   - Evaluate the depth of the
     [System Overview](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#2-system-overview)
     and decide which user population it is most suitable for, or adapt it to
     new tailored versions.
   - Expose
     [Glossary](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#17-terminology)
     as a separate document, formatted in an alphabetized table for easy
     reference.
   - Expose
     [Workflow Description](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/v1.0/in-toto-spec.md#51-workflow-description),
     which identifies the different user roles. Adapt this to a separate
     document that also points to the appropriate doc for each role, which would
     be particularly helpful to new users.

3. Arrange and choose content from existing overviews to create **High-level
   technical overviews** of increasing depth, addressed to specific audiences
   (evaluators, new users/adopters, experienced users and administrators,
   contributors of different types (ITE proposers, doc writers and editors...).

   A basic intro, possibly suitable for evaluators, is already linked directly
   from the [home page About tab](https://in-toto.io/in-toto/). The short intro
   links to the
   [latest spec in GitHub](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md),
   which contains a more comprehensive overview. (NOTE: The PDF link to the
   stable spec, `https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/v1.0/in-toto-spec.pdf` is
   broken. This should be fixed or removed.)

   3.1 Initially, transfer the tech overview content from the Specification into
   a top-level Technical Overview document in RTD, and link as "Read more..."
   from the basic one.

   3.2 Determine whether the Tech Overview currently in the spec is suitable for
   new users or for contributors, and adapt or create another version of
   suitable depth for the other audience.

   3.3 The most in-depth overview should also point to academic papers for
   further architectural detail:
   https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-torres-arias.pdf,
   https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/torres-arias

4. Sort the layered technical overviews by increasing depth, and use that as a
   guide to create the overall doc architecture.

   4.1 Add overviews as text-only pages to RTD.

   4.2 Make each tech overview the introductory page to a section aimed
   primarily at the appropriate user role or roles.

   4.3 In each section, include an index to current doc (mostly in GitHub Readme
   files) relevant to the audience. For example, the
   [ITE spec](https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/blob/master/ITE/1/README.adoc) that
   describes the ITE process, which is two levels down from main in the
   [ITE repo](https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/). The document should be
   referenced in the section for Contributors, and possibly a subsection
   specifically intended for ITE proposers and developers.

   4.4 As documents are transferred from GitHub into the Doc web site, update
   the index accordingly and adjust the doc architecture as needed.

5. Reference material

   5.1 Decide where reference docs for different implementations should live in
   the doc structure and where their sources live in the repo structure. The doc
   roadmap should clearly identify and link to the existing generated pages as
   _reference_ doc for the Python reference implementation. It should also list
   and link to reference docs for other implementations.

   5.2 Publish the policy and procedures for developers to document their
   implementations.

   - Develop a documentation policy for implementers. For example, the
     auto-generated doc for the
     [Go implementation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang)
     is not at all parallel with the Python RTD reference doc - it is all in
     GitHub, and has no introductory or explanatory content, or navigational
     aids.

6. Content creation process

   6.1 The [read-the-docs site](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has
   an
   [Edit the Doc button](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/blob/develop/doc/source/index.rst).
   Instead of pointing directly to the source files, make the button point to a
   page with instructions for
   [doc contributors](https://github.com/in-toto/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
   and a link to the
   [governance policies](https://github.com/in-toto/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

   6.2 Decide on a structure for documentation directories and source files in
   the project doc repo.

   6.3 Make sure the policy pages include or link to:

   - Contact info for maintainer/reviewer for documentation contributions.
   - Available doc style guides/templates (as well as code standards)
   - Usage guidelines for RTD (or other doc tool) and any project-specific usage
     standards.
   - Current doc architecture plan.
   - Map to documentation source files.
