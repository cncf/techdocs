# Documentation Issues

These issues identify and classify tasks that contributors can undertake to
establish a set of organized and navigable documents on the in-toto public
website.

## Create **Doc home page**

The landing page for the
[read-the-docs site](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which currently
lands on the auto-generated Python reference doc, could be expanded and
repurposed as the new overall **Doc home page**.

- [ ] To be immediately useful, the landing page should provide a _top-level
      roadmap_ to existing docs. See
      [Survey of existing doc](survey-of-existing-doc.md)

  This is a necessary step in raising the maturity level of this project. The
  roadmap should initially describe and provide access to:

  - Specification
  - Basic demo
  - Python reference implementation along with its reference docs (which need to
    move into a sub-directory)
  - Overview of the git repo structure.

- [ ] Move the Description and pointer to the Python Reference implementation to
      an Implementations section, and move the RTD reference docs for it into
      this section.

- [ ] Create a doc contributors policy requiring that the Doc home page be
      updated to reflect any changes to the doc locations and structure.

## Expose new-user information

- [ ] Move the content of the
      [README for the main repo](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto) to a
      separate **"Getting Started" document**.

  - [ ] Add a prominent pointer to the new **"Getting Started" document** on the
        in-toto home page, such as the top menu item in the "Get Started" menu.
  - [ ] Replace the README with brief introductory notes that link to the
        documentation.

- [ ] As a stop-gap, add a top-level TOC for the existing Specification to show
      what is in it.

- [ ] Move important sections out of the spec into separate documents, and add
      them to the Doc home-page TOC.
  - [ ] Evaluate the depth of the
        [System Overview](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#2-system-overview)
        and decide which user population it is most suitable for, or adapt it to
        new tailored versions.
  - [ ] Expose
        [Glossary](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#17-terminology)
        as a separate document, formatted in an alphabetized table for easy
        reference.
  - [ ] Expose
        [Workflow Description](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/v1.0/in-toto-spec.md#51-workflow-description),
        which identifies the different user roles, as a separate document.
  - [ ] Adapt the content to point to appropriate doc for each role that would
        be particularly helpful to new users.

## Create **High-level technical overviews** of increasing depth

Arrange and choose content from existing overviews to create a set of overviews
addressed to specific audiences: evaluators and new users/adopters, experienced
users and administrators, contributors of different types (ITE proposers, doc
writers and editors...).

A basic intro, possibly suitable for evaluators, is already linked directly from
the [home page About tab](https://in-toto.io/in-toto/). The short intro links to
the
[latest spec in GitHub](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md),
which contains a more comprehensive overview. (NOTE: The PDF link to the stable
spec, `https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/v1.0/in-toto-spec.pdf`, is broken.
This should be fixed or removed.)

- [ ] Initially, transfer the tech overview content from the Specification into
      a top-level Technical Overview document in RTD, and link as "Read more..."
      from the basic one.

- [ ] Determine whether the Tech Overview currently in the spec is suitable for
      new users or for contributors, and adapt or create another version of
      suitable depth for the other audience.

- [ ] The most in-depth overview should also point to academic papers for
      further architectural detail:
      https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-torres-arias.pdf,
      https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/torres-arias

## Sort the layered technical overviews by increasing depth, and use that as a guide to create the overall doc architecture.

- [ ] Add overviews as text-only pages to RTD.

- [ ] Make each tech overview the introductory page to a section aimed primarily
      at the appropriate user role or roles.

- [ ] In each section, include an index to current doc (mostly in GitHub Readme
      files) relevant to the audience. For example, the
      [ITE spec](https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/blob/master/ITE/1/README.adoc)
      that describes the ITE process, which is two levels down from main in the
      [ITE repo](https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/). The document should be
      referenced in the section for Contributors, and possibly a subsection
      specifically intended for ITE proposers and developers.

- [ ] As documents are transferred from GitHub into the Doc web site, update the
      index accordingly and adjust the doc architecture as needed.

## Establish policy for reference material

The doc roadmap should clearly identify and link to the existing generated pages
as _reference_ doc for the Python reference implementation. It should also list
and link to reference docs for other implementations.

- [ ] Decide where reference docs for different implementations should live in
      the doc structure and where their sources live in the repo structure.

- [ ] Publish the policy and procedures for developers to document their
      implementations.

- [ ] Develop a documentation policy for implementers. For example, the
      auto-generated doc for the
      [Go implementation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang)
      is not at all parallel with the Python RTD reference doc - it is all in
      GitHub, and has no introductory or explanatory content, or navigational
      aids.

## Define content creation process

- [ ] The [read-the-docs site](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has an
      [Edit the Doc button](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/blob/develop/doc/source/index.rst).
      Instead of pointing directly to the source files, make the button point to
      a page with instructions for
      [doc contributors](https://github.com/in-toto/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
      and a link to the
      [governance policies](https://github.com/in-toto/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

- [ ] Decide on a structure for documentation directories and source files in
      the project doc repo.

- [ ] Make sure the policy pages include or link to:
  - Contact info for maintainer/reviewer for documentation contributions.
  - Available doc style guides/templates (as well as code standards)
  - Usage guidelines for RTD (or other doc tool) and any project-specific usage
    standards.
  - Current doc architecture plan.
  - Map to documentation source files.
